trainer_with_eval.py

This script implements a simple evaluation‑driven training loop using the
Tinker API.  It reads a JSON configuration file describing the base model,
training data, evaluation tasks and thresholds, and then iteratively fine‑tunes
the model with LoRA until evaluation metrics meet the desired targets or the
maximum number of rounds is reached.

Because Tinker runs training jobs on managed infrastructure, you must have
access to a valid Tinker API key in your environment.  The script uses
blocking calls for simplicity but can easily be extended to exploit Tinker's
asynchronous futures (see the docs for `forward_backward_async` and
`optim_step_async`)
【645635658704514†L231-L259】.

Note: This example is a scaffold.  It leaves out many details, such as data
tokenisation and evaluation implementation, which depend on your specific
pipeline.  Fill in the TODOs with your own logic.
